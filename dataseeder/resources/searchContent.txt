CI and CD practices are extremely important to bring in Speed, Consistency and Reliability to IT
IaC Infrastructure as Code is at the core of bringing SCM into Infrastructure space and thus enabling an Immutable Infrastructure design
Docker is one of the mainstream technologies enabling us to package Applications and their dependencies into a single lighweight unit for deployment and management
Kubernetes is one of the earliest Container Orchestration technologies which helps us view all of our IT Hardware as one large deployment platform
Agile practices can be implemented far more efficiently when DevOps, IaC, CI, CD practices are in place, Basically all of these compliment each other
